Generation_2
=
Titan Generation 2 Development. Titan Generation 2 is a big project that is written in RBX.Lua. I plan to make something for it in every major language(i.e. Java,Lua,CPP) I get at least 3/4ths to get finished in.
Note to Main Developers
=
Do not, under any circumstances, put the main script on Github, or sell the script. 12packkid was easily able to guess Nebula's site, and I bet you he could do the same here. Also, when I finish the script loader, you must always use the loader. If at oxcool1's Public SB, use the HTTP loader, otherwise use the module loader. Do not let anyone else even have a peek at the script, especially scary people like tusKOr661. When testing the script, make sure to not let certain details about it get out. Last, if you see any FMer that isn't a friend of yours, KILL IT.

Main Developer List
=
Diitto: Creator and Main Developer
Pkamara: Main HTTP Engineer and Major Developer
Ultimatekiller010/Nexure: Secondary HTTP Engineer and Semi-Major Developer
Slappy826: HTTP Engineer and extensive language work and Major Developer
bomblover: Minor Developer

Regards to the Main Site
=
Developer Pkamara is currently holding the site on a PHP database, where the script is downloaded from a few sources, and brought up to you in-game in an interface that you must put the "pass" in. Once you put the pass in, if the pass is right, the script will be converted from an encrypted string into a function, then executed. If you're wondering where the Console site is, it's currently down due to Slappy temporarily disabling it, and as for the DataBase, I(Diitto) am currently working with dogwarrior24 and Slappy to decide whether to use rbxdatabase to host the site, or to use a custom Database.

Side Notes
=
("Side Notes"):match('%w-%s(%w+)')
Notes. Before we start seriously working on Generation 2, we need to gather as much notes as we can, and compile it into one place. From there, we can advance on making G2 one of the most powerful and efficient admins around. The game plan here is to release a severely sandboxed and restricted version of Titan, but with a large datastore and something like that admin script that had individual servers and could control the servers, except it will be in many games, giving us permenant admin and a lot of power in ROBLOX.
